---------
I asked the original developers if it was Ok to fork this project.  This is what one replied:


>> Hello,

>> This project is no longer maintained.
>> I think that you can fork this project and upgrade it depending your needs, but please keep it free ;-)
>> 
>> Good luck and keep us updated if you do the fork

I am concerned about GitHub's Copilot project



I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

While I do not advocate for all the issues listed there I do not like that
a company like Microsoft may profit from open source projects.

I continue to use GitHub because it offers the services I need for free.  But, I continue
to monitor their terms of service.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

A repository owner may opt out of Copilot by changing Settings --> GitHub Copilot.

I have done so.
