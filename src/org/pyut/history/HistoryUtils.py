"""
   
    This module defines the format of the serialized commands and command groups
    of PyUt's history (undo/redo).
    It gives also some tools to set keywords in the format automatically.
    
    The format is textual, based on 'tokens' (identifiers) which can have
    two forms (without the spaces):
    
        1) token_begin token_name token_end
        2) token_begin token_name token_assign token_value token_end
    
    Where token_begin, token_end and token_assign are special sequences of
    characters defines in this module.
    
    * Token_name is a characters sequence freely chosen by the developer. But be careful
    because some special sequences are defined below.
    * Token_value is only used with the second form of token. It allows setting a
    value to a token. A token value _cannot_ be similar partially or completely to a
    reserved sequence (see below)
    
    Normally, you should not use the first form, but the second one, for e.g. to
    deserialize data used by a command.
    
    To see how it works, please see `tests.UnitTestHistory`
